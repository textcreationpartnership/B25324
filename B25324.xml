            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenious Reader, this carping age I know expects an Apology, though I have done nothing worthy there of, yet lest I should infringe the Prescript of custome, (which parallel in prevalency with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) which is to premise something like a <hi>Preludium</hi> to entertaine my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I must render those Adamantine attractives which gave being to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphisis. History (not to fall into common places thereof) is a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting pillar then that of <hi>Absolon;</hi> for sure we had never heard of that pillar, had it not bin upheld by the sacred pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: It perpetuates the memory in the leaves of eternity, rescuing old age from the jawes of oblivion, adorning youth
<pb facs="tcp:200469:3"/> with gray haires of experience, so that we may well say,</p>
            <q>Nos jam jam a pueris illico nascimur senes.</q>
            <p>This induced my eyes to wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the tombs of our fore-fathers, where besides a Catalogue of those rare vertues which enriched the celestiall sparkles, their souls, there was black E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithites of vice, which more depressed others fame, then the Marble did their bodies. The first, I supposed, writ for invitation to imitate, the second to stand like an <hi>Index anchoralis,</hi> or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, lest posterity should collide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same rocke. But to draw my self into a lesser circle, finding the History of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a stranger unto us, of the same Isle: especially that of our late King <hi>James,</hi> whose checkered fortune may run equipage with the most Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. I fixed by the propitious diety, my eyes upon this production of Master <hi>Robert Johnstons,</hi> where having fed my memory with a sufficient banquet, I could do no lesse, being conscious, that <hi>omne bonum est diffusinum,</hi> then force him to leave his exoticke, and appear in our own language, but <hi>dulcius ex ipso fonte bibunturaquae.</hi> Water is best at the spring head, I know it, and desire that such
<pb facs="tcp:200469:3"/> whose ingenuity can, will read him in his owne Character, as for others, give them leave to tast at second hand: but the Author loseth his lustre, I confesse it, yet so farre as the propriety of our speech, and my weak intellect can reach I will be carefull thereof; If some criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Grammarians thinke that I wander too far from home, pray let them know I am not reading a verball translation, yet dare presume the sence of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is no wayes invarted, and who knows not that we have <hi>Anglisismes</hi> as well as the Latine have their proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; remember that sage and learned speech.</p>
            <q>Nec verbum verbo reddere cures.</q>
            <p>For the Translation I say no more, then that it was the work of one, who could say in part with <hi>Seneca, non vaco somno, sed succumbo et oculos vigilia fatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 8</note>
               <hi>cauentes{que} in dolore detineo.</hi> If my pen seeme sometime to play the wanton, know it was used in a liscencious time, and take but an inch where it might have an ell. Thus I am ingenious in confession (and so no <hi>Antinomian</hi>) be as ingenious in remitting, so thou wilt be a true Christian.</p>
            <p>The Author who hath paid nature
<pb facs="tcp:200469:4"/> her due having no Issue descended from his loynes, well knew the maxime <hi>libri sunt liberi,</hi> which caused him be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse in giving life to 22. booke, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carination of the memorable passages in this our Isle, and our neighbour of <hi>Ireland</hi> with some exotickes from the year 1571. to the year 1629. two wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only saw light, the rest running the same hazard which abortives doe, are involved in a Scotch mist.</p>
            <p>I have entirely transcribed the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Scotland,</hi> so far as is extant, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Master <hi>Cambden</hi> (who now speakes <hi>English</hi>) will supply the rest for our own Nation, that the Author had no other end then free himselfe from that tye, wherewith he stood engaged to his Countrey, may appear in all his actions an abreviation whereof it writ in these, or the like Characters over <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough</hi> Colledge gate.</p>

The integrity of my conscience, the wisedome and humanity of my Readers, who will deigne to foster, I doubt not, these my lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gave life to my resolves in displaying those heroick performances of the fore-named Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates to the open view of all.

My language is not in that Character, that an ingenuous Reader may give it an ambiguous Interpretation, or call any thing into question; seeing that naturally benevolent and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men are courteous, and so humane, as to give every man his due, not eying so nearely the ornaments of speech as the truth thereof: whereas maligning, base, harsh, detracting, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious spirits put all things well spoken upon the Rack of a sinister Interpretation, depraving the whole structure of the building, erecting strong Batteries of malice against others. If the bolts of these men are shot from the bowes of levity, or rashnesse, I matter not: if from the vulgar ignorance, I despise it: if of malice, I forgive them: But I tremble at, nay rather adore, and admire the others gravitie, prudencie, authority. It lyes not in the verge of any mortall to compose a Ditty delightfull to every eare, seeing some delight to wallow in the mire of obsolete words; while others set their repose in grave and sage sentences: others take pleasure in <hi>Laconical</hi> brevity, and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with a concise and subtile pen; others, as if offended with brevity and over accutenesse, labours after a dilated and sublime language; it's the folly now in fashion amongst our writers, to effect <hi>Caesars</hi> sublime eloquence, <hi>Cato</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusts</hi> brevity, <hi>Tacirus</hi> pompe, <hi>Livies</hi> Eagle-soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and sweetly moving speech.

But me thinks I heare some say, What a Candle at noon day, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> being every way a superlative scholar hath compiled Annalls both true, naked, comely, and delectable, of such Acts as Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:200469:6"/> Raigne produced, which might deter any other from writing thereof. Surely, that rare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor weighes as sad in the ballance of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as in any others: and by how much he exceeds in modesty, so much the more he attracts me to light my candle at his Luminary: nor can I memorize him without a congratulation, in that he would accommodate others whose minds were bent upon compiling an History, with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient matterialls, as he candidly attests in his Preface to the Reader: If so, I hope my candid and impartiall Judges (who have the authority to adjudg of my imbecility &amp; rash attempts) wil acquit these my imbicile endeavours, after so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite an Author, not to be altogether foolish, nor my undertakings rash: however, I know they will absolve me as innocent, pardon me if nocent. To draw to a haven, if any Popeling shall brand me for seeming to elevate the Queen of <hi>England</hi> above the sphere of her deserts, let him know, truth speaks not the commemoration of any benefit I enjoyed, or the hope of future advancement; it was the Chariot of those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall vertues adorning her soule, which moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her so high, for which that wicked brood in vaine envyed her; and as infamous Rebells (who had divested themselves of all allegiance and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to Prince or Countrey, barked against her in their Pulpits, against whom the wicked <hi>Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> inveighed, those whom neither fear nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, nor religion could deter from machinating the most wicked of Plots, robbing by the high way without being punished, amplifying their fortunes so far as either their violence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit could extend; hatching plots to ruinate the Nobility, disturbing the Kingdom by their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and madnesse, and faster the ignorant

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200469:8"/> Queen Mother (having devested her selfe of Majesticall robes) into exile. Nor was the period set here, for he was well nigh overwhelmed by the floods of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and buslings of the Nobility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout regency in the Weale publique, which molested his inward quiet. The slaughter of the Earles of <hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Linnox,</hi> Protectors (added more fuell to the fire of disturbance) the Earle of <hi>Mar,</hi> a man exhibiting no small lustre of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and prudence in time of his regencie, was swallowed up by I know not what sodaine death: thereupon succeeded the Nobles Election of the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> to be Regent: the residue of the Kings mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority was obscured by quotidiā whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, storms, and tempests. These o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous passages of his Fathers bitter fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Mothers flight and banishment, the most execrable murther of his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, no sooner had their exits, then the smiling face of Heaven caused af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires to succeed more prosperously, so that in future, he did as it were compose mirrors of felicity and vertue, for his Successors to behold themselves in; such may we nominate the almost lavish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and pompe he manifested in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing his Mothers Funerall, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200469:8"/> the Law revenge his Grandfathers quarrell, the sword his Fathers.</p>
               <p>In the midst of domestick disconsola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the State publique perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Morton</hi> being elected to steer the Common-wealth, the transferring of which power, converted his thoughts to the Republique, so that he by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity summoned the Nobility to hold a Parliament at <hi>Edenburough,</hi> in which was enacted divers Laws, profitable for the defence of the reformed Religion, the Kingdomes tranquility, and His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties safety; He likewise with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Parliament, decreed that such as refused the reformed Churches Communion (unlesse after warning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited) they repented of their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious madnesse, should be branded with the note of Infamy, not worthy to beare office in the State, or be advanced to any dignity. Secondly, that such as were contumaciously averse to the Protestant Religion, should lose the priviledge of Subjects. Thirdly, those whom the Church did excommunicate, to be held Rebels; Lastly, all Subjects should be bound to defend the received Protestant profession with their persons and estates, against all such Potentates
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200469:9"/> as sided with the Counsell of Trent, to the destruction of Protestants. And there issued forth a Proclamation in the Kings name, to make all Popish Bishops uncapable of bearing any office or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like employment, whether they were of Ecclesiasticall or Civil Jurisdiction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse according to the solemne forme of abjuration, they renounced publiquely their erroneous tenents: but the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Protestant Ministers who detested the dregs of popish superstition, were not to expect any diminution of honor or Jurisdiction. And it was further declared, that forthwith all Massemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers should be devested, and stript of their functions and Ecclesiasticall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</p>
               <p>These things thus established, many who were solely addicted to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish religion, yet being seazed on by fear of losing their estates, did not only sweare to the Protestant Religion, but also confirmed the same by subscription. Let not here be matter of wonder admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, that the Religion within so many precedentages, had by the three runged ladder; of mans authority, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, and popish tyranny, attained to an incredible altitude, should now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200469:9"/> at once, by the hearing of mans threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and feare of loosing estates, fall flat to the ground.</p>
               <p>But to make our progresse in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Churches reformarion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men were elected Ephori, or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call them, Superintendents, who were invested with authority to ordain, chastise, or displace Ministers: these men not differing from others either in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite or dignity, governed Nationall, Provinciall, and Presbyteriall Synods, according to the dictates of their owne will, every man being attentive to the opinion of Superintendents.</p>
               <p>This institution had its rise from the downfall of the Romish, and restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestant Religion, on which depends the Kings splendor, the Kingdomes security. The Regent <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> conceived the Function of Prelates to be no lesse necessary then commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet he desired that it might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that Orthodox Bishops in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> should be regulated according to the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> rule, that such Bishops as were blinded with the mists of Popery might be ejected, wishing withall those who were to enjoy the title and revenue of the Bishops, should
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200469:10"/> be men of quiet natures, and that they might freely give their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be abridged of exercising autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over other Ministers, wholy abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from that part of their Office: so great, so free was the power of Synods, Presbyters, and moderate Presidents in that tempest.</p>
               <p>Religion thus setled, and the Princes safety so observed, <hi>Morton</hi> had time to take a view of Civill and private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; he had a vigilancie, least any thing obnoxious to that obligation of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> amity might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the education and conservation of His Majestie: He conferred on <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Eskine,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Marr</hi> being as yet rather fit to be educated then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate, he constituted <hi>George Beuchanan</hi> (a man ascended to no little height of same by the scale of learning) his Tutor which with exquisite care and diligence in teaching him piety to God, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to men he performed.</p>
               <p>These things being in agitation, <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Duke of <hi>Castle-herauld,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arguile</hi> and <hi>Huntly, Hume, Seton, Haris,</hi> auncient Barons of the Kingdome, withsome others who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in no inferiour sphaere, seeing Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200469:10"/> adorned with Majestie, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the State in the hands of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector under a childs domination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to murmur against the Vice-royes government, and withstand him, by leaning to the French faction, least o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise his authority might be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated: But to overturne a governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established by Parliament, was of more difficulty to effect, for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor being by these blasts and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions awakened, became daily more cautelons, and fortified himselfe against such attempts by the forts of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens love, prudent deportment in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and renowne of his friends; yet hee would not bee adverse to any counsell, tending to tranquility, if such a happy Star might appeare in that horizon.</p>
               <p>Much about this time <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous for being a Temple Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and an imitator of the <hi>Vandalls</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations, under the pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ruinates the monuments of our Ancestors piety, suffering not so much as Church bells or leads to scape his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criligious raving hands, a beaken apt to have put the whole Kingdome in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of war.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:200469:11"/>
               <p>These things thus upon the Stage, <hi>Morton</hi> extinguished the lustre of repute he had already lighted, and that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the future to kindle, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie of one infamous fact, which was thus: The Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland</hi> adjudging their case despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at home, fled privately into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that so they might either by flight or private lives divert the currant of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; <hi>Charles Nevill</hi> Earle of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland</hi> sojourned at the house of <hi>Carr Farnihurst,</hi> or <hi>Buckclough,</hi> untill fearing the <hi>English</hi> Army under the conduct of the Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> he made his escape into <hi>Flanders,</hi> there spending the residue of his days in indigency. As for <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (a man of auncient Family) the Lady <hi>Fortune</hi> (whose will is her law to rule by) gave him the ignoble and forsaken woods of <hi>Harcley</hi> for habitation, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades were the Grames, infamous for robberies, who had a greater eye to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate wickednesse, then to keep their promise, they nefariously deliver this banished Earle lurking in Cottages, to <hi>Murrey</hi> the Protector, who least hee should be thought to desert his office or trust, dreaded to deliver him to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:200469:11"/> up of his enemies. But after that <hi>Morton</hi> being placed on the pinacle of honour, falling either by the errour of his minde, or longing after money, spontaneously delivered <hi>Northumberland</hi> (whom honour had made great, and to whom he stood engaged by the tyes of demerit) into the hands of <hi>Henry Cary,</hi> Baron <hi>Hunsdon</hi> governour of <hi>Barwicke,</hi> for some reward promised; But <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> (a branch of that great stock of <hi>Piercies</hi>) not long after was lopped off with the fatall Axe at <hi>Yorke:</hi> the fruit of so ungratefull wickednesse, the Protector received in the <hi>ultimum</hi> of his life, as if God punished such a fact.</p>
               <p>The knife of envy ere this had parted the Kingdome into two unnaturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Son and Mother, King, and captivated Queene; In this dissention many of the Nobility displaying the Banner of publique good, strove to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their owne honour and potency; <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were not wanting in frequent Missions to attract the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites to accord, and lay downe their armes: But the <hi>French</hi> K. sent <hi>Monsieur Viriac</hi> Embassadour into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to see in what condition the Kingdome stood in and to supplant peace, if it lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200469:12"/> the virge of his effecting, which part he exquisitely performed for the Vizor of his Embassage permitted him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to stand as spectator, but to act the somenter of War against the Viceroy. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on the other side per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the plot was as diligent to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him, which Shee did by dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Henry Killegrew</hi> Embassadour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he might do his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate devoir in resisting <hi>Viriac</hi> by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Protestants.</p>
               <p>The Protector delighting more in the pleasant streames of peace, then in the bloody waters of war, endeavoured in a long Oration made to the Nobles, to induce to concord, conjuring them by their fidelity and allegiance to bury in oblivion all private injuries, so to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the thoughts of war, as that they should be had no more in remembrance, to remember the forgetting of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies and discords, nor try the last of refuges; For which prudent mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, those who had not tasted of the bitter roote of affliction, congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his endeavours, and desired God prosper him in this buisinesse. <hi>Killegrew</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Embassadour gave sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of his desires to reduce the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200469:12"/> Kingdome into the haven of tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but <hi>Monsieur Viriac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or rather the <hi>Guises</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, strives to launch her forth into the deepe of Civill broyles by his allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Chiefes of <hi>Scotland</hi> to restore Popery, and violently re-establish the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in her Throne, assuring those of the <hi>French</hi> Faction (if their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions hold firme) should be assured of aide ere Long.</p>
               <p>After this many conferences of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure were betwixt the ringleaders of either party, at last Truce was taken, and <hi>Perth</hi> appointed the place of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: the love of peace and quiet, and loathing of war, are principles which nature hath endued us with: the time of consultation was not to be till the tenth of <hi>February,</hi> and till that day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening was come, all acts of hostility were to surcease, and so continuing till the Treaty ended.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse <hi>William Kircade</hi> Lord of <hi>Grange,</hi> Governour of <hi>Edenburough</hi> Castle, whose fiery genius made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in this sweete harmony of civill concord: The Nobility of both Parties desired him not to be so averse in so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200469:13"/> happy an opportunity for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, nor to set the State upon the rack of discord, under pretence of siding with either Faction: but this wholsom counsell could not any wayes demoove him from his more desperate progresse: whether it were that hee was excited thereto by his confidence in that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable place, against which hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed neither force nor art could so far prevaile as enter or demolish, it being provided with Ammunition and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for a long siege. The Castle hath the advantage of an high rock inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable on every part, and fortified by a Fen or lake on the side, and a moate which surrounds it. It may be likewise supposed his courage was sharpned by the whetstone of hope which he fixed on the <hi>French</hi> Forces ready to come, whom he supposed would free him from all exigencies, in that he had sent his brother <hi>Iames Kircade</hi> not many dayes before into <hi>France</hi> to make knowne their condition, and implore them to send men and money; But how closely soever this crafty counsell was kept, yet it arived at the Regents eares, who knowing the Castle of Blacknesse sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Now accurate <hi>Kircade</hi> knowing well that he was circumvented, and at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies disposall, corrupted his keepers and watch with those few crownes hee had reserved, so that by the sodaine change of <hi>Fortunes</hi> wheele, and souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers perfidiousnesse who were on the

               <p>The Sunne had not twice runne his course ere <hi>Stuart</hi> with his unarmed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not harbouring the least suspition entered, and by the souldiers whom <hi>Kircade</hi> had suborned for the betraying, was presently cast into prison: where having a guard set over him, was kept in fetters; But the tediousnesse of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment caused him study revenge, and opportunity of alienating his Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the souldiers affection from <hi>Kircade,</hi> so that he might entangle his adversary in the same net which so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caught him, he being dressed in the garbe of squalour and sorrow, made the indignity of his condition the subject of a dolefull story to fill some of the souldiers eares, entreating them by all those old tyes of souldiers fidelity, by those many hard-ships whereof he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated with them, to commiserate his case, and repaire the breach of trust made by them or their Comrades, by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting some noble exploit of trust; Lastly, to wipe off by some officions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200469:14"/> performance, when opportunity might be their owne, those blots of disgrace injected upon that <hi>quondam</hi> Governour, the very deformity of their so closely circumvented, &amp; depressed Governour, and the remembrance of his former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, caused the common souldiers melt with pitty and compassion, and in this nick of time, <hi>Fortune</hi> presented a pat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the souldiers acceptance for innovation of their condition, and thus it happened: <hi>Kircade</hi> to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate himselfe a loving Husband, would with his maeniall servants accompany his Wife, departing from him out of the Castle: but he was no sooner forth, then hastily shot out by the combined souldiers, who brake open the prison doores, and caused a sequestration passe twixt the fetters and <hi>Alexander Stuarts</hi> leggs, setting him gently at liberty. He (<hi>Fortune</hi> delighting to play the <hi>Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> part) of a President became a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of a captive is become a Captaine, and the Castle (as if willing) to shew it selfe a changeling to day, it favoured this, yesterday the other party.</p>
               <p>While frequent betrayings, Peers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting, &amp; Regents murthers, infested the Kingdome, the most emminent of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200469:15"/> either party wearied with the sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so long and grievous dissentions upon the forementioned 10th. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> met at <hi>Perth,</hi> to consult about the reducing of the Kingdome to its former quiet. The Viceroy accompanied with others of the Nobility of the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appeared; for the Queens party, there was present the Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> the Queenes Vicepresident for the North parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the chiefe of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and the rest whose affections were conglutinated to her, there it was concluded by the interposition of Qu: <hi>Elizabeths</hi> power; After long debates had about the conjunction of King and Queen in Regency, that there should be a cessation from armes on both sides, and an act of perpetuall oblivion upon all offences committed, except the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the King, <hi>Murrey,</hi> and <hi>Lenox,</hi> Protectors: private wrongs were to be forgotten, <hi>least</hi> concord should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, and private and publique inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were to have their pardons, al mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary souldiers to be disbanded, save foure companies which the Regent was to keep on foote so long as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might conceive any profit accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence to the Kingdome; all should

To fulfill these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, both parties were bound by oath, delivering of Hostages, and other pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, so that civill dissentions grew slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and Peace was obtained by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors speciall vigilancy and care: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the Lord <hi>Grange</hi> (a man rather blowing tempests then commodious breath) both despising the King and Viceroyes authority, not desiring the security of his Countrey, sought more for the opportunity of fomenting War, being fed with the maine hope of aid from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For no sooner was the Truce expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but he thundered with a minancing kind of noyse upon the City of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burough,</hi> infesting the Citizens with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall excursions, making their houses sacrifices, by throwing granadoes and scalding pitch thereon; Hee sent such thundring Nuncios into the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous streets in the City, as that scarce

Nor was the <hi>Edenburgians</hi> much short of him in rage, after they had once taken up armes in defence of their City, For being set downe before the Castle, they cast up a slight worke, not ceasing night and day to raise Forts in such convenient places as might hinder the <hi>Castillians</hi> excursions, so that their City was not so much exposed to the fury of the merciles fire, although their houses were shot thorow, yet they walk in more security: to conclude, they turne the edge of <hi>Granges</hi> violence &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they divert the waters course, that in stead thereof, affliction might run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castle: the diverting of which, and the mingling lime with the water in standing pools, caused many slight skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes; At the foot of the rock sweetly issued forth a fountaine of very pleasant water: to defend which, the besieged sallied out at a postern, erecting a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work that might scouretheir water: &amp; such as were wont to go up and down for water, the besiegert on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strove to cut them off from it, thus no day passed, wherein <hi>Mars</hi> did not display his bloody colours.

               <p>The Protector (least he should spend his time to no purpose) sent divers convenient men to divert the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the Queenes party, and to embrace peace, and to this end proffers him very reasonable conditions? While

                  <hi>Morton</hi> seeing the fiege prolonged, the Governours audacity, and the slow progresse in besieging, produced more to the befiegers, then to the besieged; withall considering that his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200469:18"/> small forces were not potent enough to enter for a place every way fortified, sent to implore of <hi>England</hi> men and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which was condiscended unto, upon these conditions, that the Viceroy should not make any composition with the besieged, without the Queens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that he should not receive, protect, or succour any <hi>English</hi> Fugitives; and if the Castle should be surrendred, that what ever was in it, should be free boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the besiegers, save what was the Kings Utensalls or precious Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Protector being great with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to obtaine the Castle, grants all the Propositions. Not long after, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Navy laden with Cannon, Engines of all sorts, powder and iron bullet, &amp; other ammunition, rid at anchor in the Haven of <hi>Leith</hi> neer <hi>Forth,</hi> where the Sea stretcheth forth one of her armes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the floods?

               <p>The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> having joyned Forces ere they mounted their Canon, sought by all meanes possible to have the Castle surrendred: but the Canons of treaty not making any breach in their breasts, they begin furiously to assault the Castle, so that 4. of the Castle Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers begin to tumble for fear: then moale like they undermined and raysed Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon the sharpe side of the hill. Since nature had prohibited the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding it, <hi>Drury</hi> supplyed what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was desicient for opposing, so that no man might passe in or out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. That performed, hee mounts 30. brasse pieces, with which he batters the walls for foure dayes together without any intermission, so that in fine <hi>Davids</hi> Tower receiving many wounds, yeelds it selfe captive to ruine, and with an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noyse layes its airy head on the ground, leaving the Defendant naked
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200469:19"/> to the ecemies fury: the first day when as yet there was scarce hope left of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, while their bodies were not defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, they valiantly received the charge, and maintained the breach, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ever and anon Embassadours to death, or the Chirurgions, to tell them that the Messengers had shewed more of tumult then valour in entring the wals, art countermined art, and force was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with force, having hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured what cruelty could afflict. At last they begin to dispaire of their strength, either in that the Cannons sent such shours of lead (which watered their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with drops of blood) or that the rocke brake, or their houses fell, or in that the number of their slaine and wounded were many, or that Captain <hi>Trotter</hi> was fallen, who while hee lived, made good the breach with his owne sword.</p>
               <p>The <hi>English</hi> perceiving their courage to be queld, filling the ayre with their cryes, sets ladders to the lower walls halfe ruinated, getting over, some few resisting, and those few ill armed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance being already conquered with griefe, were beaten down; The souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the lower tower seeing themselves

All was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved now to yeeld, a parley was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the next day Truce was taken, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ley</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man, and <hi>George Fleck</hi> a <hi>Scot, Morton's</hi> Sisters son, were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as Hostages. The Lord <hi>Grange, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Melvine,</hi> and <hi>Petarow</hi> climing over the walls, for the gates were obstructed, (<hi>Knox</hi> his prophesie in this being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished) came to treat with <hi>Drury:</hi> Their demands were to enjoy life and security, but could obtaine nothing, save to yeeld themselves and all they had to the Queene of <hi>Englands</hi> mercy: In this pittifull plight and deplorable condition (seeing the laws of necessity must be obeyed) they yeeld themselves up the Conquerours pleasure, and the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> mercy: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldiers laying down their arms were safely dismissed. After the Castle was surrendred, many considerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were taken prisoners: among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:200469:20"/> these were of speciall note, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Hume</hi> being the flower of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and in the flower of his strength, the Lord <hi>Grange</hi> a man couragious and valiant, Secretary <hi>Matlain</hi> renowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong strangers, and adored by such as knew him for his valour, with <hi>John</hi> his Brother, who afterwards was Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whose youth was decked with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vertue and excellency in Arts, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the immitation of his Brother, <hi>Petarow</hi> one of great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and estimation amongst those of his owne Faction, <hi>Robert Melvine</hi> whose accurate ingenuity could sustaine the most weighty affaires; besides <hi>Cockman</hi> and <hi>Mosney</hi> two rich Citizens of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burough,</hi> and the renowned Countesse of <hi>Arguile,</hi> the late wife of <hi>James</hi> the fifth, who was the daughter of an Harlot.</p>
               <p>Thus skill and valour of the <hi>English</hi> in besieging, caused the Castle and 200. souldiers to surrender themselves in the space of 33. dayes; as for <hi>Matlaine,</hi> hee lay long under the tyranny of the gout and crampe, which ceased upon his wholebody. Natures candle being come to a snuffe, which was extinct by the breaking in of that vast Ocean of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and sicknesse while hee was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:200469:20"/> at <hi>Leith,</hi> or else he dyed voluntarily to avoid the enemies severity: he was a man whom nature had adorned with the accoutrements of accuratenesse and prudence, and would have exhibited the same, if <hi>Fortune</hi> (the over-swaier of humane counsells) had not delighted to make him like her selfe, blinde with publique calamities, but mortals are not cautelous enough to withstand <hi>Fortunes</hi> fury. It was reported that <hi>Matlain</hi> poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned himselfe: after the Castles surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>George Douglas</hi> the Regents Brother with a guard was sent to receive the treasure, guns, and the Kings Utensels, the souldiers according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having the goods and treasure gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for pillage, which the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens had sent thither as to a most safe treasury. Not many dayes after, Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> pleasure was exhibited and made known, the Lord <hi>Grange</hi> and his Brother <hi>James</hi> were executed by the common Hang-man in the Marketplace of <hi>Edenburough,</hi> where the people dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his gallantry in its colours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating how great &amp; how many gulphs of dangers he had shut for the publique liberty, what attempts he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:200469:21"/> the safety and honour of his Countrey, when he was even ready to suffer death, no tongue suffered his former renown to be forgotten, notwithstanding all this, the sad remembrance of their City burning, being fresh in their memorie, cryed so loud in their eares, as they sought revenge by seeing him suffer: <hi>Mosney</hi> and <hi>Cockran,</hi> both Gold-smiths, took their journeys into another world from the Gallows,</p>
               <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> obtaining of the Protector that the lives and estates of <hi>Hume, Petarow,</hi> and <hi>Melvin</hi> should bee preserved with the rest, onely their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shonld be imprisoned: by this act of clemency she became admired for mansuetude and mercy,</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>English</hi> seting a period to those disasters, they came to quiet, (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither by invitation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and compulsion of <hi>Grange</hi> his rashnesse) leaves <hi>Scotland</hi> in tranquility, and with the losse of a few men retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their prize to <hi>Barwicke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The raging stormes of civill war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overblown, the heate of killing, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and spoyling were allaid. And now <hi>Morton</hi> to induce the bloody minded &amp; warriors, to embrace peace, quiet, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:200469:21"/> humanity, with great diligence educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the noble young branches in the liberall sciences, that the publique safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Kingdomes tranquility might have firme foundation; he did not give any manifestation of grudge against the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who were in those days no lesse potent in power then allies, but rather labors to compose such differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as kept the Nobility disunited; &amp; to this end calls a Parliament at <hi>Edenbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> in which, for the publique good, he suppresseth divorces, adulteries, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging, murthers, rapine, burning, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and luxurie, besides many acts he passed against cosenage in bargaining, and out of the rest selects a chiefe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (whom long experience had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knowledg fit for such underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings) to consult about State affaires. Hee made all Malignants to become As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen leaves, austerely punishing such as had contaminated their hands in the late Kings blood, or were any wayes conscious thereof: he constituted Sir <hi>John Carmichell</hi> a gallant spirit, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Marches, gave him an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all stipend, and the command of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souldiers as might prohibite those violaters of humane institutions, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:200469:22"/> casting off all obedience to the league, made incursions and wasted the borders of <hi>England:</hi> not to expatiate, he brought forth many hopefull blossomes for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture government, being of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable presence, to receive the popular applause, in that he trod in the steps of moderation, not satiating or thirsting after blood, but with the sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice cut away all corrupt matter where ever it was.</p>
               <p>This weather was too faire to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, for seeing himselfe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with command, hee lets loose the raines, riding after lust and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, making incursions into the Subjects coffers, &amp; under the pretext of Justice, makes the Law denounce seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that hee might the sooner fill the jawes of his greedy avarice. This so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine commutation exhibited as sodain rumors, for <hi>Fame</hi> now began to blast, rather then blazen his name. He called the Court Officers to such a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counpt, as that they did not without some misery performe: having exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted their treasures, they were then to informe the Judges selected for that purpose, of all that had eaten flesh in <hi>Lent,</hi> who were commanded to appear:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:200469:22"/> and if they could not free themselves thereof by oath, the Judges pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them guilty of the breach of the Law, and inflicted punishment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Statute, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor seldome or never remitted: but when he perceived the Commonwealth impoverished, he supposed it safer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance privately the Kings coine, then publiquely to gape after the Citizens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. And now being Lord of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fortune, he maintained his retinue with the dignity of moderation in food and aparrell, converting both publique and private riches to honour &amp; magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, erecting that Palace of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to his no small charge, adorning it with Tapestry and incomparable pieces of art, so that its splendor almost soars to a Majesticall statelinesse; he caused rich pieces of silver and gold to be coyned which to this day is hoarded up in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers coffers: on the one side the gold bore King <hi>James</hi> the sixts Portraicture, with the inscription of <hi>In utram{que} para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> on the one side: on the other side was a Lyon rampant, <hi>Mars</hi> in a double tressure counter flowred, being the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> within this inscip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Partere subjectos, et debellare super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos:</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:200469:23"/> The silver pieces bore two swords with <hi>Trajans</hi> Motto, which hee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the sword delivered to the Major of the City.</p>
               <q>Pro me si mereor, si non, in me.</q>
               <p>He was the first that brought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of brazen coine to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: for the <hi>Scots</hi> before this had nothing currant but gold and silver, which now was corrupted both at home &amp; in the Netherlands by the Merchants, who being slaves to their unjust gaine, transported the starling money into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign parts.</p>
               <p>These his exactions were observed by an ingenious foole of his, <hi>Patricke Bovy,</hi> who used ever and anon to rub his Masters soares, as may candidly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this subsequent story. It so fortuning that some importunate beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers beseeched the Viceroy to relieve their poverty: which being over-heard of the Foole, it was as earnestly begged to have these importunate fellows bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which moved the Regent extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so that he told him he was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable man, not to shew mercy to those that so ardently sought it: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Foole instantly replyed, what and if ye commit these as fuell to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:200469:23"/> flames to day, ere the Sun shall run his course, to morrow you can make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich men beggers, intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that his rapacity being conjoyned to covetousnesse, eate up the Citizens fortunes.</p>
               <p>But in conclusion, having reduced the Kings coffers to a little purse, hee sets upon the Clergie, purposing to make them a bit to stay his hungry sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; Such Benefices as were vacant, the revenue being small, he bestowed upon any Protestant Ministers: but those of a greater' value were conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given to Court Preachers that his clyents and favourites might have some annuall fruit of their labour; His spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brats were the enjoyers of Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and other Church Beneficies which were no lesse faire then profitable; In this storme these were the barnes into which the spirituall mens harvests were gathered.</p>
               <p>But be pleased to go retrograde with me in observing the Churches Ataxy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the beginning, for it is worth your review. Upon the Protestants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for the sustentation of their Ministers, seeing all the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls were in the possessions of Papists:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200469:24"/> Shee assembled the High Priests, the Prelates, and such of the Popish Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as were of especiall note, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather then entreating them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause reliefe could be no otherwise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the Protestant Ministers to put to their assisting hands: Shee was confident there was not any in that great Convention who would ether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to relieve or excuse the Ministers poverty, which Shee desired might bee done willingly, in that the diminution of their fruits could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury. The issue of the meeting was a setting a part of the thirds of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualties, with which her Majestie was to relieve the Orthodox Ministers, as if it were a meere donative; But the conclusion seemed to either party a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion. The Popish faction grievously complained that their wings were clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the Protestants suppose themselves not at all sublevated by that affected munificence.</p>
               <p>After this a Remonsteance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters stipends is drawn up to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector <hi>Morton,</hi> which he seemes to take into serious consideration, promising to cut the Popelings avarice, and with if all cause of strife, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:200469:24"/> would not be deficient in any thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Church, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Minister whose life and doctrine were inculpable, should be supplyed with a competency of estate annually, if that the thirds might be granted His Majestie: The Clergie was induced by this pollicitation to subscribe to the compact, obliging them irrevocably to performance. The Viceroy catching the fish he angled for, knowing he wanted ability to perform what was promised, hee supposed it the best way (as the case stood) to commit the cure of 3 or four parishes to one man, that out of the reliques of the thirds might arise a great treasure: this he conceived to be the best gaine those times would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
               <p>But the Church (although in vaine) exclaimes that the convenant was infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged while hee made all fish that came to his net, the Ministers were instant and urgent with the Protector, declaring that to appoint Ministers for every Church, and more ample stipends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the agreement for every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, was a matter no lesse requisite then of absolute necessity: he with great reluctancy after much debate, refers the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:200469:25"/> businesse to the Cuncel-table, to whom the Clergy exhibited their bill of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against the Viceroy (men of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency in the State) declared their sence therein, but nothing was obtained of the Viceroy save delayes; the griefe of this repulse stuck so fast in the Clergies breasts, as that twixt them and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent there was a cessation of friendship, which instigated them perpetually, and openly to chastise his libidinosity, dissect his avarice, and aggravate the matter by invectives: but all this winde would shak no corne, for their thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring words was so far from terrifying of him, as that hee did not so much as stop their mouths.</p>
               <p>Much about this time (after a long perigrination) <hi>Andrew Melvine</hi> returnes to his native soyle (if my judgment fail me not) in the thre tongues, and other polite learning, was not inferiour to many, so exquisite in the Pulpit and lists, as the Andrepolitan Divines could not goe equipage: and in Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> both his doctrine and authority were more prevalent then any other mans, he being seasoned with the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vevian</hi> discipline, drew some young heads to embrace his opinions, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But he supposed that if this Discipline should be established, he with some others of his associates, might steere the Ship of the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as they pleased; to effect which, he inveighes against the office of of Bishops openly in the Pulpit, defaming them so that they might be depressed, with what envy could inflict; hee professed that there was a parity in the ministery, and that Ministers were not inferiour to Bishops: and those Tenets were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner broached then there were two sorts of men to drink it up; one was Laicks, supposing this the direct way to obtain Spiritualities into their own disposing; the other was Clergy, who by the slip of ambition grew higher in the desire of honour: these men inflamed the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready incited people by their hot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and state-medling Sermons, which caused an unbridled and indomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:200469:26"/> licentiousnesse of tumults; a great part of <hi>Scotland</hi> had their affections conglutinated to erect the <hi>Geneva</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, and extirpate Episcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and dignity: these vapours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising caused a cruell tempest, which tossed the Arke of the Church. In this storme the Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Glascow</hi> laboured with a strong hand against <hi>Melvine,</hi> administring such things as that season required. <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> made his ingenuity shoot poynt blank at the <hi>Geneva</hi> Discipline, accurately confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the Pulpit, wounding <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and his Independentiall Tribe even to the soule, by the sword of his preaching: but the dissentions after long exagitation flew as high as the Vice-Royes eares; hee being a man without all controversie, who knew to fish in such molested puddles, was not much grieved at the Clergies clashing, supposing that in the future all Bils of complaints henceforth would arise from the Clergy: so that he by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fanning the fire of debate, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgeth destruction for them, then laboured to extinguish it; when as it became him to have fought against

               <p>The Orthodox party being afflicted by diuturnall mollestations, made pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous complaints of the injuries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies wherewith they were opprest, desiring the <hi>Protectors</hi> Auxiliatory hand against the Church disturbers; he by this time being defatigated with cōnivency, labours to take up the quarrell, putting them in minde of the assemble at <hi>Leith,</hi> where hee exhorted them to follow peace amongst themselves, not to raise any uproares under the pretence of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, not to innovate any thing in the reformed Religion, so long as the King was in his minority: for the Vice-Roy was not ignorant of the animosity and violence of these Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian Innovators: the Nobility plots, and the Clergies Pleibeian spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, determining so long as the least spark of composing their dissentions did but appeare, to endure all things: but his patience and former connivency
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:200469:27"/> gave such fuell to the flames of the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> fire, as that neither riches, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or counsell could extinguish; so that it had beene farre better never to have given them a sword, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to have resisted them being so prevalent.</p>

               <p>While these sparks of intestine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions were rather raked up in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers than dead: the Papists and such of the Nobility as were blinded by French presents, consulted more like so many Franticks then Counsellours to seize upon the Princes person, and so to carry him into France, and to disrobe the Vice-Roy <hi>Morton</hi> of his authority; But the Protector was not difficient in wit or prudence to divert those furious streames and imminent dangers: for as from the beginning he had protected the English party, so had he kept the French under his girdle; withall repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his whole confidence, and the kingdomes safety in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as in a sure refuge, desirous to sift out what opinion those who were about his Majesties person had of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining very harmlesse followers, who by their sugered and oratoricall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:200469:27"/> even enchanted all tender eares.</p>
               <p>Now lest a gap might be left open to ambition, and his enemies hatred, he was vigilent over the Churches tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, the Cities safety, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes incolumnity, and his Majesties honour, and when the poore could find no redresse in their miseries from the Judges Tribunals, he constituted others to heare their complaints. Great was the respect he exhibited to <hi>George Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> one whom the Muses had adorned with their influences, more than any of his contemporanians, whose fame was augmented, by the speciall care demonstrated in educating King <hi>James,</hi> with all politick learning, and wisdom: nor did his respects rest solely in <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> but it extended it selfe to every good Tutor. But now you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Scene altered; for <hi>Morton</hi> heretofore intentive on publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, now whether by human frailty or by the destiny of ruling became infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with lust and avarice, polluting the secret Chambers of the pallace by the foule blast of adultery, and deflowring of Virgins, thinking thus to wax strong in pleasure, became
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200469:28"/> weake in body and authority: for hee was a frequenter of unseasonable riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, baths, and such places which art or nature had made delicate: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the insupportable ponderosity of the weale publike, he invents exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and nimble wayes of poling the Commons, and seeing that there was not any subject for him to exercise his sword upon, he pretended to lay <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes</hi> wood equall with the ground, in that it was a receptacle of Theeves: and when the earth called for weapons, into whose hands she may pay her Tribute, hee called for all men who were able to beare Armes to march after him against this great Forrest, and all to be in readinesse at the sound of a Trumpet: but there being a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of divers musterings, he gave over the expedition, disbanding such as were content to pay for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: but the rest continued in armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Read</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi> disposing his whole estate upon pious uses, and maintenance of Students, was frustrate of his desire by the Vice-Roy, who made his Testament null and of no validity: (as if hee had authority to dispose of mens fortunes) threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200469:28"/> to inflict punishment upon the Executors if they should eudeavour to fulfill his Will and Testament: nor did he stay here, for in a most ravenous manner he invaded Houses, Lands and Treasure, confiscating the richest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants estates, as if guilty of most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes, defrauding them of their most proper goods.</p>
               <p>Nor did his rapacity onely catch flies, but he soared for great Fowles, such of the Nobility as were descended from ancient Progenitors, he oblitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with some blot or other of their Ancestors, which hee had collected from the leaves of Antiquity, exacting of them vast summes of money, which were as so many additions to enlarge his fortunes: but recollecting himselfe, supposing that the Nobilities love and mutuall amity were materiall props to uphold his sliding power, he begun to foment enmity, jealousie, hatred, and injuries amongst them, that so matter of offence (which consequently indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth punishment might be administred.) But although they were affronted by whole troops of contumelies, charged with multitudes of injuries; yet they deferred to seek revenge until opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

               <p>Lastly, this horse-leech exhausted so much treasure out of the veines of the body of Scotland, as his Coffers could well containe, stretching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe forth to embrace covetousnesse, and avarice, and this was all under the pretence of publike service: which not onely enriched himselfe, but also his favourites patrimony: also he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that <hi>England</hi> might be within the line of his avarice; for he desired that some annuall stipend might be assigned to him, and those of his party: but Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was adverse to his desires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seconded by her counsell; which denyall had the taste of an injury in <hi>Mortons</hi> pallet, so that hee laid it to heart.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After this he summoned the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in <hi>Scotland</hi> to assemble, (under the specious pretence, about the restriction of robbing on the Borders) but the event was to consiscate mens esrates, notwithstanding all other pretences: but the discovery augmented his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and diminution of authority. Thus whilst the Protector became vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for his avarice, a suddain accident happened, which administred cause of complaint to the English, and had well nigh been a Leak to let in whole floods of warre into the State: which was thus. Sir <hi>John Carmichel,</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Governour of Lidsdale, Sir <hi>John Foster,</hi> Governour of the middle bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; with the Governour of <hi>Barwick, Francis Russell,</hi> eldest sonne of the Earle

But <hi>Carmigell</hi> retorts his arguments on him, layes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the grievances which the English had brought into the Borders by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quicting them with plundering and spoyling. When these sharpe soares were in dressing, (haughty spirits not brooking a haughty word) 'twixt chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and striving arose a tumultuous hubbub amongst the Borderers, who had encompassed the Governours: in the dispute <hi>Carmichel</hi> was made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; Victory residing on the English brow; so that they tooke that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to pillage the Scots of such things as were brought thither for sale; but while they gazed too much on plunder, and were hurried with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200469:30"/> the Scots surprised the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for they raising the Countrey by their clamours, as they runne through Townes and Fields, gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a body at <hi>Jedburgh;</hi> from whence marching towards the English, they made fury, and the sword hew a way through the sides of their enemies, to regaine their prey: the number of the slaine on the English part were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, amongst the rest Sir <hi>George Heron,</hi> Knight, <hi>Carmichell</hi> espying the defeat, made his escape to the Scots, whom he encouraged to charge home: the flying English, lest that they should make a safe and faire retreat. The Governour <hi>Foster, Francis Russell</hi> his sonne in law, <hi>Cuthbert Collinwood, Henry Fennicke,</hi> and divers others perceiving an escape im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, accepted of quarter, who were carried to the Regent at <hi>Delkeith;</hi> He received them with all courtesie, and after they had entred Bond to appeare at a certain day in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he sent them home with a safe convoy.</p>
               <p>But this disaster was no sooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Court, by the wings of Fame, beiug secouded by letters from the Governours own hands, then the Queens minde was lifted off the hinge
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200469:31"/> of patience, and hurried away by the violence of anger: nor did <hi>Carmichell's</hi> fact so much incense her, as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ambition, or rather negligence, besides the <hi>Scots,</hi> (whom shee had next under God) reduced to their pristine liberty, dignity, and safe tranquility, should against all law or right in time of Treaty fall upon the <hi>English;</hi> and to lead away in a triumphing manner Sir <hi>John Foster,</hi> with that hopefull and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious noble youth <hi>Francis Russell,</hi> who sought onely to escape out of deaths jawes: Nay after all this to the contumely of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, force a subscription, and delivery of pledges for their returne, these were as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goads to drive forward her already incensed minde: the transaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of put both the borders in a posture of warre, which were ready almost to joyne battle: but <hi>Morton</hi> shewed his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall prudence in accusing the <hi>English</hi> heady Governour, who caused the multitude run into this offence, in beseeching her Majestie not to condemn him, ere she heard him answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, desiring her Highnesse remember his ancient demerits, and what great fires of trouble would have their being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200469:31"/> from this spark of dissention, and how it might stand with her Majesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to raise a warre, which must be maintained with the blood of many of her loyall Subjects, and all for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a few: but if Shee would not lend an eare to his humble desires, then lastly let her but looke upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause, which begs a defence of the peace betwixt the two Kingdomes, lest that <hi>Scotland</hi> having a deficiency of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi> ayd, might be necessitated to call in the <hi>French,</hi> that the hand of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence towards <hi>Scotland</hi> might not be contracted by reason of this sodaine tumult; he likewise declared that there was not any thing done by publique consent, but 'twas the fact of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and souldiers as imprudence or fury had precipitated, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of a dammage: besides it should be very perspicuous to her Majestie, that ere time was grown much elder, he would doe such good offices for her State, as might countervaile those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences already happened, and as for questioning the Governour in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he answered that the President in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<seg rend="sup">ths</seg> Reign, was his apology: for when expiation of Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:200469:32"/> (that noble Knight and governour of the <hi>Middleborders</hi>) death was sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was concluded that there should be a meeting held in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Governours had power to enquire after all misdemeanours, plundering, pillaging, and spoyling, and that to be performed without any dram of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or envy. But the producing of such a hoary headed instance, rather stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated then repressed the Queens anger; for Shee supposed that this act of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing a place of convening, was a staine cast upon her honour, and that it rather flowed from the Regents arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of minde then otherwise; and to remedy these injuries, Shee askes advice of the Councell-Table which way shee should stear her course: some aggravates the complaints more then the rest, but all make such cruell and ingratefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities as were done to her Majesties faithfull Subjects by the <hi>Scots,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their exclamations; others again insisted upon the Regents haughtinesse, in deciding the controversie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but all of them concluded, that so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a tumult (not worthy the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning) was to slight a cause for wage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war. The Queen being overcome by

This though not without a certaine reluctancy of griefe, yet by a necessary compulsion was condiscended unto.

               <p>In this boysterous tempest the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scians, whose pursuite was alwaies after innovation, knowing that the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes authority was daily villified, they publiquely anatomized his words, acts, and counsels.

               <p>The deprecators &amp; Nobility of the adverse party were more prevalent with the King, then the objected crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; amongst other things it was voted to have him deposed: hereupon the Chancellour <hi>Glaymes</hi> desires the sufferages of all the House, and in fine, he declares that by Vote <hi>Morton</hi> was to relinquish both Magistracy and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: thus the fortune of one houre overturned the felicity of many yeares.

               <p>The Nobles assembling at Court, do institute Trimestriall Councellours, who were to propose to the Councell-Table whatsoever his Majesty was to negotiate, and these men were to be elected by the Parliament, alwayes to be ready at Court to direct and protect his Majestie in all consultations and authority, for the King did not do any thing either publike or private, but such things as these assistant Nobles, who as Tutors, should approve of; such as were chosen enter upon their Office at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and Clientwise they execute their quotidian Offices, being probationers of the young Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, indoctrinating him how hee ought to demonstrate himselfe a Prince and Patriot to his country; the three months of their function being at an exit, others of the Nobility, whom prudence and vertue had given Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the rest, were constituted Guardians, with the like authority as was granted to the former.</p>

               <p>Much about this time <hi>David Lindsey</hi> Ea: of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and <hi>John Leon</hi> Earle of <hi>Glaymes,</hi> Chancellor (men whose birth made them move in an high Sphaere) were Dissonants, not Consonants: the discord arised from a controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their bounds, and fostered by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and abitter emulation twixt their followers, insomuch that they were at deadly feud. <hi>Glaymes</hi> for his paciferous wayes, mercifull judicature in the civil Law, prudency and moderation, was held in great repute; the other being nervous by his strong affinities of noble descent, and great atchievements, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy of behaviour, magnificence, &amp; riches, advanced him to the title of <hi>Craford;</hi> but as his life was inquinated
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200469:43"/> with luxurie, so <hi>Glayms</hi> his dayes were adorned many, and those egregious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours being a pattern of gravity and dignity. It so fortuned that an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py altercation was incident at <hi>Sterlin</hi> twixt their Followers, which came to that height that a hubbub was made, in which <hi>Glayms</hi> was slaine by a bullet: He no sooner was dead then the dignity of Chancellour was translated upon <hi>Athol,</hi> one as he succeeded in place so according to the common account in vertue and prudency; the atrocity of <hi>Glaymes</hi> death, excited the mindes of most well minded men: but above the rest <hi>Thomas Leon</hi> was a most eager young gallant to revenge his Uncles death, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom was constituted a Tutor, who strove to make fire and sword avenge his and his Families injuries, making many devastations into the <hi>Lindseyes</hi> countrey, nor lesse bitter was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by the adverse party.</p>
               <p>These depopulations arriving at Court, caused the King by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Councell to dismisse Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, which might declare a cessation from further acts of hostility, so long as the matter might be descided by law.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200469:44"/> was cast into prison for the death of <hi>Glayms;</hi> yet by the earnest and ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Nobility, not long after was safely dismissed as he returned through <hi>Angus,</hi> the Inhabitants congratulated his Freedome: this was like a new fuell to inflame <hi>Glayms</hi> Tutor unto so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement anger, as that <hi>Craford</hi> all his life was glad to stand in a souldiers posture.</p>
               <p>The deposing of <hi>Morton</hi> exalted the precisian hopes, in erecting the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Discipline, and diruating the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall wealth, so that Pastors, Deanes, and Superintendents should rule; these mens endeavours had been furstraneous by the procrastinations and delayes of the Viceroy, while the King was under his protection. Upon this a Synod was held, wherein the cherishing of faction was more agitated, to the prejudice of his Royall Majestie, then matters of divine Worship: there the Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the Regency of Ecclesiasticall affaires should be managed by Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, declaring that Bishops ought only to take care of one Church, not execute Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish Episcopacy, and omit the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of divine duties.</p>
               <p>The King by the interposition of his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200469:44"/> Councells-authority, withstood the Synods decree, by revokeing the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his own breast.</p>
               <p>In the conflict about the Prelaticall Jurisdiction, the Arch-Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> was the valiant Champion to defend their cause and dignity, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with more then fiery zeale, that the dignity whose institution was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, whose power for so many ages together had stood inviolated in the Church, might not now suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack by this precise party.</p>
               <p>But the adverse cause had for their Captaine <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> a man famous for Divinity, yet give me leave to say his precipitate minde and anger over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swayed his prudency: he vindicated an equality in the Ministeriall function, and liberty in the Church, admonishing the Bishops to be of humble and meeke spirits, neglect riches, not to follow the streame of the times, hungring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wealth and power, nor let pride or arrogancy domineer: for Religion and the true Worship of God would bee shipwrackt unlesse men tooke downe their top-sailes of pride, insolency, arrogancy, unlesse they would cast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verboard their lugga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of riches, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:200469:45"/> and honours; remembring that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they came into the world. But his Majesty could not away with <hi>Melvins</hi> proceedings, because he withstood the Prelaticall dignity, and arrogantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to pluck the Plumes of the Churches ancient authority, seeking to erect a Statue of honour from the ruines of the Bishops disgrace.</p>
               <p>Thus sick and ill disposed was the Churches estate; and although the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisians were prevalent in number, yet there was not wanting Nobles who stood as pillars to uphold Episcopacy; the King having communicated the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to his Counsell, and hearing their determinations, made answer to the Antiepiscopall men, that hee would himselfe governe the fainting Church; that they ought to infuse and instill piety and subjection into the peoples heares, abstaine from innovating any thing, to follow peace and concord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Bishops, and not be authors of dissention in these tempestuous dayes: this answer being given, there was not any to whom it was not conspicuous, that the Authority of Episcopacie would rather be augmented, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished whilst his Majesty was at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:200469:45"/>
               <p>Thus the matter was crushed by a hand of moderation for the present, so that no other remedy was to bee had but patience, when all hopes of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Clergy to accord was relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: it seemed good to the King, and his most renowned Nobles to declare their determinations about these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent distractions, and admonish the Clergy not to make any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the division: the Episcopall party answered, that they were ready to submit to his Majesties command, but their Antagonists were altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory; continually after in a furious manner ensulting over the Bishops in their pulpits, as if they arrogantly more eyed their own commodity and profits, then their sheeps safety: an arrogant act of ministers: for what can be more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, then for an ordinary Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to teach the Bishops in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus you see many and vehement were the Contentions 'twixt <hi>Melvin,</hi> and the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrewes;</hi> the Arch-Bishop answered <hi>Melvin,</hi> (who contumaciously and haughtily railed against Bishops in the open Schooles) with such an <hi>ex tempore</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200469:46"/> fervency, and gravity, defending the honour and dignity of Prelates, as that hee easily attained the applause: <hi>Melvin</hi> after this neither would, neither was able to encounter with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop in publike, in that he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe overcome by eloquence, but stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to contaminate his life by a Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Epigramatizing, stirring up the peoples hatred against him, omitting nothing which might any ways diru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Bishops authority. This bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of preaching, excited the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest to that boysterousnesse, as the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the Kings Minority; for it laid a gap open for all dissentions to enter in.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:200469:47"/> to continue in their places untill his Majesty arrived at maturity of age: these men as skilfull Pilots steered with such art the Common-wealth, as that for a while matters succeeded with more serenity: their eares were open to heare the complaints of the poore, whose faces were grinded by the tyrannous oppression of the mighty, and under their wings they shrouded themselves: many other Lawes were made as pillars to confirme the state of the kingdome, amongst the rest, whatsoever Grants, Charters, Letters Patents, Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties issued from his Majesty, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving approbation of six of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and the Subscription of the Lord Chancellour, were to bee of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity.</p>
               <p>In these tempestuous blasts appeared that preheminent vigilancy and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, which <hi>Atholl</hi> Lord Chancellor had over the weale Publique; the execution of the Lawes were his exercitations, his Princes safety, created him watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and he gave many demonstrations of an egregious and faithfull Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and that the rather because the Earle of <hi>Morton,</hi> who having eased his shoulders of the burden of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

               <p>This subitaneous and boysterous disaster being carryed abroad by the wings of Fame, caused the Nobility &amp; Counsell to meet in a hostile manner at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where foure dayes were spent in deliberating about the publike quiet, and the Kings safety, whose age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him into the hands of others to be ruled.</p>

               <p>These disputes 'twixt Uncle and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew were laid aside by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arbitrators, which was, that the young Earle of <hi>Marr</hi> should be held the most noble of that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, should solely bee Governour of the Castle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and Guardian to the Prince, according as his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors had beene: but if hee should goe to his grave, not leaving any issue, then the honor to be translated unto his Uncle: for the present, <hi>Alexander</hi> was to keep his Regency in the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough:</hi> as for <hi>Morton</hi> (although he was dejected, and involved into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery by the precipitate fury of <hi>Arguile</hi> and <hi>Atbol</hi>) yet he would have condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to any reasonable conditions of concord.</p>

               <p>He in the interim being not ignorant how turbulent a storme of envy appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ingendred from those ruines of malice, harboured in the Nobilities hearts, did what in him lay to attract unto his faction by the Load-stone of favours, riches, potency, by conferring
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:200469:51"/> Court offices, and publique prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on divers persons, his haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was grown to the height, that he could no longer dissemble it, but abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the trimestriall vicisitude of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and now hee will trample upon the neck of his adversaries, foaming with anger, rusheth headlong to his own ruine; thus hee added fuell to the sparkles of malice which was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, but rather raked over with ashes in the breasts of <hi>Arguile, Atholl,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse:</hi> He challenged the second place after the King to be due to him at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> usurped or rather monopolized the steering of all things; This irritated the leaders of the adverse party so far, as to draw up a most bitter satyrical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against <hi>Morton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How that in administration of affairs hee had behaved himselfe like a libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, proud, covetous creature: that hee who because hee sold himselfe over to avarice, was degraded from Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, now by Serpentine windings strives to obtain a continued Magistracy, that hee usurped his Majesties authority by Act of Parliament taken from him, swayed the Scepter in the interim, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the constitution of serving the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:200469:51"/> Prince by course, enervating the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of publique counsell, that his breast might bee the Oracle on which the Prince might solely depend for counsel and authority: they proceede likewise to let the Privy Councel and select No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility understand how that his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and violence were inconsistent with legitimate magistracy, desiring not to suffer such unjust power to sway: but if hee should contemne the Kings minority and Councels authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then they would be propugnators of such wrongs; But in conclusion the Citizens were desired to take armes for the bringing to condigne punishment such as strive to enervate the force of Parliaments, which was the Subjects freedome, against such as had demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the trimestriall vicissitude of giving counsel, and solely usurped authority over the Kings Majestie.</p>
               <p>His Highnesse was at a stand, not knowing to what this swelling would ptove, however his royall resolutions were fixed on a meeting to be held in July following, which He divulged by letters, summoning the Peeres and the Antagonists to appear in Parliament, where they should expect Justice. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:200469:52"/> place for convention was <hi>Edenburough,</hi> where many of the Noble Order were assembled, who secretly enter Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant one with another: this arriving at <hi>Mortons</hi> knowledge, he determined to make fractions of that whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Edenb.</hi> which derived its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the weak age, &amp; constitution of the Prince, affirming that the place was destitute of pleasures and health, that <hi>Sterlin</hi> was a place more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. <hi>Arguile, Atholl,</hi> and <hi>Montrosse</hi> the Innovators, proposed the contrary, that such of the Nobility as assembled at <hi>Sterlin</hi> did not legally congregate, that <hi>Edenburough</hi> the place appointed was pat for the busines in agitation, that the meeting at <hi>Sterlin</hi> where the Earles of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Marre</hi> recided at Court, were full of armed souldiers, that the concourse of people might open a gap to their enemies, so that there could not be any security for life or free agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when surrounded with fears of an overawing power: besides this was an offront offered to the major part of the Nobility, who had chosen <hi>Patrick</hi> Lord <hi>Lindsey</hi> as a Commissioner to let his Majestie know thereof.</p>
               <p>The Kings answer to their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:200469:52"/> was, that hee would take care of the Nobilities security if they came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> by putting the Citizens in a defensive posture against any subitani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commotions or accidentall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, so that jealousies of an overaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power should be taken away.</p>
               <p>But the time for meeting grew neer, and according to their wonted course the Peeres were summoned to give their Votes in the Court of the Castle at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> not in the Common hall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usual course, al there present accorded without reluctancy in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and the true worship of God: there deliberations were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and univocall in affaires of State.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Edenburgian</hi> Nobles decreed to declare by their Commissioners <hi>Montres</hi> and <hi>Lindsey,</hi> that the convention had in the castle of <hi>Sterlin</hi> was against the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Laws and auncient prescript, nor was it legall, withall protesting that what ever was there acted, to bee illegall, disorderly, and of no validity, seeing the major part of Peers was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for feare of death. The Delegates comming to <hi>Sterlin</hi> caused a sodaine and frequent convening of the Nobility
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:200469:53"/> to heare what Propositions were brought: where the Kings Highnesse being adorned with his purple robes, Scepter, and other Majesticall Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, answered that it was not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in what part of the city they met, in that care was had of his safety against any approaching ruine, that the Court was ready to entertain any, exclude none, that their not convening in the common hall should be no prescript to posterity, that none went about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite his moderate Tutelage, but hee enjoyed the same liberty, which was granted to his Ancestors: that it was his sole desire not to innovate any thing against his Predecessors lawes or institutes, nor enervate the authority of Parliaments, nor yet revoke the houses suffrages, that which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had proposed to his Majesty, or which the States ordered, the same ought to be established; that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just to suppose the opinions of some few should countervail the votes of the whole house, for no other cause then inane Jealousies which their guilty consciences dictated; Lastly, he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated that all Acts had passed legally and rightly, approving the Parliaments
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:200469:53"/> authority by open proclamation, and commanded that <hi>Montrosse</hi> and <hi>Lindsey</hi> should be under free custody, separated from the commerce of all, to impede colloqution and negotiation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels twixt them: but <hi>Montrosse</hi> made his escape by the Keepers fraudulency (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding divers horsemen) were sent to prosecute and bring him back.</p>
               <p>Hee upon Eagles wings posting to <hi>Edenburough,</hi> where in the convention of the Nobles, he declared their eminent dangers if prevention were not had, &amp; force resist force, so that such injuries should not be unrevenged. The fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of these stirres put themselves in a posture of war, the Families of <hi>Humes</hi> and <hi>Cars</hi> siding with them.</p>
               <p>Having consulted what was to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they rayse forces, and imploring aid of their Allies, Attendants and friends, they march forward with some troops of horse and foote, promising them pay, declaring that their taking up armes was to set the King at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, restore the Nobilities dignity, and the Kingdomes safety and liberty.</p>
               <p>The Kings Majestie although begirt with this sodain commotion, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly declared by <hi>Mortons</hi> advice,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:200469:54"/> that unlesse the Chiefes of that faction would lay downe their armes before such a day, let them expect to be dealt withall as common enemies to the State.</p>

               <p>On the contrary, <hi>Angus, Marr,</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> doe the same for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> besides many of the Nobility come thither upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their Princes safety, and their owne affection with a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Commonalty. <hi>Athol, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile, Montrosse▪</hi> and their friends with 10000. armed men, pressed in their march many High-land men or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers associating, pitched their tents in an open field nigh the Chappel Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The next day <hi>Kennedy</hi> the chiefe of that Family, and <hi>Berganie,</hi> with 400. gallant horsemen conjoyne themselves, the Nobility would not move further, having greater hopes in the besieging of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> then in its oppugnation.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Angus</hi> in whom was deposited the chief strength of the Kingdom, marched before with a party of 500. horse to scout out and take all straglers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers, thence arise a light skirmish twixt the horse, while <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> leading up the Army, consisting of a promiscuous multitude, encamp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the fields adjacent to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> obstructing all passages, and keeping strict watch: this done, the troopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. One thing is memorable, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Tait</hi> a fierce man of <hi>Tevidale,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of honour, challenged <hi>James Johnston</hi> servant to the Lord <hi>Glayms,</hi> a man whose valour was found true upon the touch-stone of experience, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the challenge, causing his spurs give an alarm to his horse, couching his launce in his rest, rage was so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the encounter, that either shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed their lance in the others body: <hi>Tait</hi> being Deaths prisoner, fell from his horse, the launce (as if detaining that his Masters Antagonists should survive) being fastned to <hi>Johnstons</hi> thigh nigh the horse, overturned him.</p>
               <p>While this tragedy was on the stage, Sir <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> the English Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour intermitted no time to mediate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:200469:55"/> a peace by his progresse and regresse twixt the opposites, sometimes beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nobles to commiserate their own fortunes, and looke backe to His Majesties incolumnity; after a long time spent in debate, it was concluded by this intercession lest fraudulency might issue from the fomentors, or lest the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might forrage, both parties were to disband, only some few horse were to be kept on foote for restraining the Borderers from plundering: <hi>Arguile, Montrosse,</hi> and <hi>Lindsey,</hi> were selected Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellours, and eight men were appointed Commissioners to determine the controversie amongst the Nobility, to nominate the Governours of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burough</hi> and <hi>Dumbarton</hi> Castles, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Nobility to their lustre, and to preserve the laws and customes of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thus when the armies were ready to drown each other in blood, peace as the common good for all <hi>Scotland</hi> (in her white robes) appeared, but its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance was momentary, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the promulgation thereof by proclamation in the City Royall: the Nobles hereupon take their journy to <hi>Edenburough,</hi> that their faction might be

In the interim His Majesty, whose desire was publique serenity, bends his news to pacification, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Chiefes of either party that jars and dissention were ill beseeming Privy Councellours: and to consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the discord, He proposed these Lords to be Moderators, <hi>Lindsey, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Ogilby, Innernesse,</hi> for <hi>Arguile, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesse, Buchan, Ruthen,</hi> and <hi>Bode</hi> for <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> The Commissioners neither seeking excuse or delay goe about the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: after a long debate held at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> it was concluded, seeing dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were obnoxious to the Nobility, mortiferous to the Crown and State: on the contrary peace was the onely safety of the Kingdome: The Nobles were not only to extirpate dissention, but consummate the Warre, so that in stead of malitious enemies, they should become friends, and in stead of mortall enmity there should be immortall friendship. And although there was not omission of any thing advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to concord, yet the breach could not be repaired, for <hi>Arguile</hi> knowing

                  <hi>Morton's</hi> insinuations was so obstinate as no conditions would be embraced, unlesse the other was debarred of all commerce with his Highnesse; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Morton</hi> perceiving himselfe unable to grapple with the Nobilities envy, and defatigated by the procrastinations of these present troubles; having taken his farewell of the King, departed the next day, many of his friends bringing him to <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> Afterwards he allayed the furious animosities of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the lenitives of prudency, and moderation, asswaging that execrable hatred with vertue and observancy.</p>
               <p>The matter now was in that posture, as that the supporters of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie were become friends, and their Retinue even sought opportunities to congratulate each other, ten men were select for further conference, the Earle of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Newbottell,</hi> Sir <hi>James Balfour</hi> Knight: <hi>Thomas Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy</hi> of <hi>Bergany</hi> and <hi>Peter Hay</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for the Earles of <hi>Atholl</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile:</hi> for <hi>Morton</hi> were the Earle of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Dumferlin,</hi> the Lord <hi>Boyde,</hi> Sir <hi>John Gordon</hi> of <hi>Lothenwar,</hi> Knight, and <hi>James Halliburton</hi> of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> The place for Convention was at

               <p>The Lord of the Privie Councell to sublevate the indigency of the Kings coffers, declared by Proclamation that the Kings Coyne should bee of greater value, this was overbitter a potion for the Citizens to digest, who had learned in the Schoole of experience that the augmentation of price on silver, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the augmention of price on victual, and vendible commodities, besides grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter detriments would ensue to the Kings revenues, Exchequer and patrimony; but the Lords threatned to imprison such as refused obedience, yet the feares of prison could not deterre them from obstinate contumacy, upon the neck of this Proclamation issued forth another to Proclaime them Traytors which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, the terror hereof caused obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this austere course was fathered upon <hi>Morton,</hi> in that hee had tryed all waies to raise monies.</p>

               <p>This year <hi>Margaret Douglas</hi> yeelded her selfe to the coacting lawes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, a woman of a Princely Majestie, in the 63. yeare of her age, descended from <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, for <hi>Margaret</hi> his elder daughter was assigned for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Crown of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and by the applause of the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons betrothed to <hi>James</hi> the fourth, of whom sprung <hi>James</hi> the fifth.

               <p>About this time His Majestie sent the Abbot of <hi>Dumberlin</hi> to congratulate her Majestie of <hi>England</hi> for her mutuall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards him, for her desire of peace and concord: after the congratulation was ended, he desired Her Highnesse to reestablish the league of Edenborough, to cohibite the tumults upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, to compresse all machinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Religion, to make restitution of such goods as had beene violently taken by the Bordering robbers, to perpetuate the amity between the two Kingdomes, and if it were possible to connect them in a more restringent tye of Covenant.

               </p>
               <p>The Queen answered Shee was ready to grant any mutual league for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of either Kingdome, and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion: but as for the patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> it was of more difficulty then to expedite in so short a space, besides it was a matter fit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation; seeing the Embassadour had demonstrated by many arguments▪ and historicall examples, that the King of Scots was Heir by an undoubted title to his Ancestors patrimony, and that was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:200469:59"/> the proper patrimony of his Majestie, which was a sustentation for his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations; whereupon hee earnestly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Her Highnesse that the estate conferred upon the Kings Ancestors in the County of <hi>Huntington,</hi> successively by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> should not be denyed his Majestie which was her neere Kinsman.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:200469:60"/> his minde brought him to his exit, or a delaying and consuming poyson took him hence, according to the supposition of some (which I rather credit) in that all the symptomes and paths of poyson were apparant in his cadaverous bulke; the obsequies were celebrated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of tears, multitudes, and a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet at Edenburough in Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church, where all the ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to honour, were executed: upon the Tomb stood the Effigies of a Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can delacerating her breast with her beake to give the young sucke, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that hee was ready to sacrifice his blood in defence of the Kingdome: the suspition had of <hi>Atholls</hi> death fell sad upon his Corrivall <hi>Morton.</hi> Hence was it that after the solemnization was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated, grievous contumelies were injected upon him, and <hi>Athols</hi> Lady even wearied with a more tedious sorrow, sends forth sad complaints, in fine an apparition of reconciliation appeared twixt his accusers and him. <hi>Arguile</hi> one who suspected and abhominated the thoughts of his friends death, succeeded him in the place of being Chancellour.</p>
               <p>The King although milde towards his Nobility, yet was inflamed both by

               <p>The Earls of <hi>Mar, Angus,</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> marched with their allies, retinue, and souldiers into the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> possessions, the rest of the Nobility and Citizens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Councels decree, were to send aide▪ the Earles sent forth parties

               <p>In the interim, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Claude,</hi> the sonnes of the Duke of <hi>Castlebraull,</hi> seeing no safety to consist in Armes, and the Kings forces to be in severall places, fled forth of Scotland for fear of <hi>Anguse, Marr,</hi> and <hi>Morton:</hi> when they had reached a place of refuge, they take counsell whether it were better to try the mercy of the French or English, although Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was great with anger against the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> for siding with the French Faction; yet the sublunary vicissitude, and renown of their Progenitors, excited her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:200469:62"/> to give them an harbour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the weather-beaten Boat of their fortunes: and she sent Master <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> unto his Majesty; earnestly to intercede for them. Tell me, did he ever come forth of his mothers womb who to behold those miserable objects of a most strange fortune, with their deare wives, and sweet children fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them, would not have burst forth into commiseration? and were they not the more to be pittied, in that they rather chose thus to bee afflicted then raise Civill warre in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which surely they might have done.</p>
               <p>Much about this time, did <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> being now an Exile, desire her Majesty of ENGLAND in some convenient time, to take into consideration her miserable condition; and if neither consanguinity, or her being borne a free Prince, although bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of her Kingdome by a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Rebellion of Subjects, could not move her, yet let pitty prevaile to suffer her reigne together with her son, which she supposed would be an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld act of clemency. But these her petitious, and humble obsecrations,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:200469:62"/> could not revoke Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to lenity and commiseration, in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving consulted with the Scots, they made answer, her liberty would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve their Nation into a most sad and destructive warre; for she would labour to revenge the injuries done her, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the young Kings authority, and change the State and Religion.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the greefe falling from such hopes, earnestly intreated the Kings of France and Spaine not to suffer her who was allyed to them by Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, Nobility and degree to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in prison: but to revenge these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, late Rebellions, and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her Subjects; these motives were prevalent with the Kings, who fostered a hope of restoring her to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and former dignity. Secretary <hi>Nay</hi> a French-man, was immediately dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into <hi>Scotland</hi> with Letters, and private Mandates from Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> where he arriving, required to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Kings presence, to consult about the state, and condition of his mother: his Majesties Counsell having read the Title, running thus: Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to James the sixt Prince
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:200469:63"/> of that Name, stormed vehemently thereat; insomuch as they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entertaine those haughty Letters, nor messenger; both because that instead of writing to the King, she had writ to the Prince, as in diminution to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, especially seeing the King was lawfully enthroned by her consent. The Messenger notwithstanding perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciously assevered that the power of Regency was in the Queen Mothers hands: the Privy Counsel therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to remit him answerlesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Queene would Rectifie that fault, and write to the King of <hi>Scots;</hi> which if she denyed to performe, shee might surcease in hoping to receive her desires. The Monsieur being hereupon irritated, incon tinently departed: The Queen of Scots understanding by him, how there was no way to impetrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, unlesse shee renounced her Title, subscribing not onely to her son but also to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>The Court was spread over with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Libells, which spoke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Poetically, otherwhiles Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, besprinkling <hi>Morton,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Illustrious Nobles with Obliquie. The Authors of these spurious brats
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:200469:63"/> were one Turniball, and one sirnamed <hi>Scot,</hi> who after judgement past on them, were executed in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of Sterlin, after an unusuall manner; for the custome was to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Libellers, either with temporall banishment, or confiscation of their estates. <hi>Morton</hi> by vindicating his quarrell in this more severe manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came odious.</p>
               <p>These things thus in agitation, there came into Scotland <hi>Amys Stewart,</hi> Lord <hi>Obigny,</hi> so called from <hi>Aubigny,</hi> a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> who was lineally descended from <hi>Lenox,</hi> being the sonne of <hi>John Stewart,</hi> brother to <hi>Matthew</hi> Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who in the Kings mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority was Regent: this <hi>Amys Stewart</hi> was supposed to have beene sent over by his neare allyes, the <hi>Guises,</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Religion: or as others thought, <hi>Montrosse</hi> and <hi>Arguite</hi> sent for him to overturne <hi>Mortons</hi> authority: or at least to break the Truce 'twixt England and Scotland; he arrived at <hi>Leith,</hi> where his Majesty commanded that he should be received with especiall honour, and so in great state he was carryed to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;</hi> from thence to his Majesty at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where comming into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:200469:64"/> Chamber, he prostrated himselfe, desiring the King of Heaven to blesse his Majesty with perpetuall felicity: No sooner did the young King see him, but in that hee was so neare allyed in bloud, of so renowned a Family, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ornaments of body and minde, tooke him up and embraced him in a most amorous manner, conferred on him presently a rich inheritance; and that he might be imployed in state-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, elected him one of his honourable Privy Counsell, Gentleman of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and Governour of <hi>Dumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Castle.</p>
               <p>But this Trumpet of Fame being heard over all Britaine begat envy, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially because <hi>Obegny</hi> attracted the Scots to the French amity, and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to revoke <hi>Thomas Carr</hi> of <hi>Farni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst,</hi> a faithfull servant to the exil'd Queen from banishment: You may be pleased to look back to the Originall and discent of <hi>Lenox</hi> in France, <hi>John Stewart</hi> of the same Line, in the reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh, when open war was proclaimed 'twixt England and France, transported an Army over for their ayd; for which hee was created Master of the Horse, in a conflict at</p>

This man was of a milde Genius, if the Chariot of his minde had not been driven by violent perswasion, he was ready to relinquish troubles: his fidelity to his Soveraigne, was vnblemished, love to the Nobles great, Fortunes darling for three yeares, afterwards the subject of hatred and domestick troubles: to say no more, he shewed himselfe worthy of his Progenitors, and family of <hi>Lenox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majesty summoned a Parliament to be held at <hi>Edenburough</hi> the thirteenth of October, where he resolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all mutations of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be in person; nor indeed could
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:200469:65"/> the raine, stormes, hideous blasts, and lowring heavens dimove him from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this necessary journey: upon the way from <hi>Sterlin</hi> to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he with his Nobles and followers were so weather-beaten, that it was night ere they came to <hi>Limnough,</hi> where lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that night, the next day they came to <hi>Edenborough.</hi> And on the first day of the Parliament, hee being invested with his regall Bobes, bravely moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rid in great state through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Parliament house, the Nobility and Clergy according to their degree going before: thus was his Majesties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Principality solemnized with great splendor, the Imperiall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were supported by <hi>Archibald Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angusse, Collen Cambell</hi> Earl of <hi>Arguile, Robert Steuart,</hi> Earle of <hi>Lenox.</hi> After these came his Majesty adorned with the rayes of Imperiall glory, his Retinue, and servants waiting upon him: This rare spectacle was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive to draw the multitudes eyes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; so that they follow the King with clapping of hands, venerations, and prosperous wishes: ascending his Tribunall, in few words he briefely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Lords, having taken their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200469:65"/> places, that this concourse of the States, elevated his soule on the wings of alacrity, seeing it tended to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of the Common-wealth, that he was conscious how his Nonage administred occasion of Commotions, that he reposed his chiefe hope of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, peace and concord in their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Lastly, he calls God to attest that his intentions aymed onely at the preservation of Religion, Subjects safety, and Kingdomes security.</p>
               <p>The Parliament first cast their eyes upon Religion, enacting that those sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should bee esteemed Members of the true Church, who professed that forme of Confession agreed upon in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1567. And agree to the Prescript of administring the Sacraments in act and will; that no Religion was to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed Orthodoxall in Doctrine and Discipline, save that the Scots embraced, in the present. The Nobility were not to transmit their Sonnes into forraigne Countreyes, unlesse having a warrant from his Majesty: which obtained, the Travellers were to oblige themselves both by oath, and subscription, that they would observe inviolably the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Canons of the Church of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:200469:66"/> the Church of Scotland; that every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily should have and retaine a Scottish Bible. The power of Ministers was likewise confirmed to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, administer the Sacraments, to censure mens behaviours, and chastise Delinquents, the Discipline erected publikely by Bishops and the Super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

The next thing agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was that of the <hi>Hamiltons;</hi> many of the Nobility demonstrated the equity of their punishment, returning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thanks and praise for his care had therein, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Claud Hamilton</hi> whose veines flowed with Noble bloud, and other fifteen of especiall note in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, upon the discovery of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a generall Vote were held Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, for the death of <hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Lenox</hi> Regents, to have their Estates confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which were no lesse delicious then fructiferous booties. The next Scene which came upon the Stage was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Paslet</hi> to <hi>Obigny,</hi> and <hi>Arboth</hi> to <hi>Marr:</hi> There were not wanting some, who even burning with anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, excited his Majesty utterly to abolish the name of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> and the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:200469:66"/> chiefe of these men was <hi>Morton:</hi> but the King having more respect to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then their fury, would in no wise condiscend to this unheard of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, supposing it rather fit to apply such Remedies as the Lawes prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
               <p>There was a Remonstrance delivered to the House concerning corrupt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures, depraved Judges, favour, bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, covetousnesse, that the Lawes were invalid; nor indeed could they suppose any use of Law, seeing that the chiefe Judges had their judgement in their owne breasts, and the Lawes exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to the punishing of Wives or Servants corrupted with gifts.</p>
               <p>The Parliament to augment his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Treasure, revoked all annuall pensions, which were conferred on divers persons in the Kings Minority. The Donation of the Earledome of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> translated to his Uncle <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> was revoked, and by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament conferred upon <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> brother to his Grandfather who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly resigned it to <hi>Obegny,</hi> being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earle of <hi>March: Obegney</hi> was first created Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> afterwards ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the honour of Duke.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:200469:67"/>
               <p>The State thus constituted, the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miltons</hi> repressed and condemned both by Law and Act of Parliament, the King at his comming to the Crowne, won the hearts of his Subjects by his Religious behaviour, strict Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, faithfull followers, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of carefull Guardians; so that with great Festivity hee returned to <hi>Sterlin</hi> to recreate himselfe, where <hi>Lenox</hi> begun to be very remarkable, in that hee received into especiall favour <hi>James Stewart</hi> of Okeltry, who had shewed himselfe in Holland a very ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Commander, although of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Genius; and <hi>William Stewart</hi> that valiant Field Marshall, whom I have mentioned in another place. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife obtained a Pardon for <hi>Carr</hi> of Farnihurst, although <hi>Morton</hi> strived earnestly to hinder it; who comming back was not unmindfull of <hi>Lenox</hi> his late favours, and <hi>Mortons</hi> inveterate injuries, beginning to fanne up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunningly the sparkes of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>But now while <hi>Lenox</hi> ingratiated himselfe into the Kings favours, his enemies privately endeavoured by vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar rumours, and Plebeian malice to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:200469:67"/> make him odious, reporting that hee machinated the destruction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, subtilly promoved Popery, weakning the Kings faith: nay, some popular men were so bold as to say in open Pulpit, that he was sent by the Guises to overthrow Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, foster the French Faction, and disturbe the Kingdome. These hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous complaints, that the Court harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upstarts, who were ready to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the Kingdome, and Religion: in the Kings unexperienced yeares, so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Majesty, that after consultation with the most of the eminent Clergy, he selected some few of them to instruct <hi>Lenox</hi> in the true Religion, conjuring them by their Allegiance and fidellty to lay aside all private grudges, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly endeavour his Conversion. They returning his Majesty humble thanks fortheir election, ascertained the K. that they would endeavour what in them lay to performe his highnesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; and <hi>Lenox</hi> promised himselfe to be ready to heare them. Their congresse was daily at <hi>Edenborough</hi> for conference; the Controversies fled to the Scripture for authority: the Conclusion was, that <hi>Lenox,</hi> whose soule more hungred
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200469:68"/> after truth then contention, yeelded to their perswasions; so that in presence of the City Magistrates, and prime of the Ministery, besides a great conflux of people, he changed his faith, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Papall superstition, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Reformed Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his former errors; and for this Religion he would fight; for this he would exhaust his veines: nay for it he would lay downe his life. Although this act was pleasing to his Majestie, and major part of the Nobility, yet blind envy, the dayly companion of fortune, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hereupon his Majesty was more moved, so that he was carefull to declare his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity &amp; confession of Faith; to which afterwards he and his meniall servants, and those of his Nobility, whom bloud had advanced to great dignity subscribed, that the more confidence might bee reposed in his officers.</p>
               <p>In the Interim <hi>Obigny</hi> taking his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards his Majestie, residing in Sterlin, spent some few dayes sporting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in quiet and rest, besprinkling the

The author who had laid those snares he knew not: yet this hee knew, that who ere he was, he was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a lyar, (a word as bad as a dart to a Noble-man.)

When <hi>Morton</hi> was almost appeased, <hi>Argaile</hi> his ancient emulator began to reblazon this report, intimating to the Councel-Table this bold enterprize of transmitting his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie into <hi>England:</hi> but this weak asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having no other staffe for support then his word, was overthrown by the bare denyall, which he durst not prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

               <p>A secret fire of contention was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the bosome of <hi>Ruthen</hi> Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, descended from the height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of no lesse potency in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and of the young Lord <hi>Oliphant,</hi> whose dignity and love run equipage with his opposites.

This accident put the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-Table into a posture of great care, lest that they should assemble their friends and Followers sodainly to bang it out bravely, which made them take the controversie into consideration; they found that the tumult arisse from both parties. <hi>Oliphant</hi> and his Followers being contaminated for the

               </p>
               <p>The day of his Triall approaching, the Family of the <hi>Douglasses</hi> were great with rage, that so Noble a spirit
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:200469:75"/> should be oppressed by one of a dayes production: the Earle of <hi>Angusse, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> intimate friend, and kinsman was grieved at his deteining, he with five hundred horse, leaving nothing unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, (laid in ambush to intercept him in his journey, and threatned <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> with fire, destruction, sword, and banishment, if any greater punishment should afflict <hi>Morton.</hi>

               <p>To prevent all plots hatched by the <hi>Douglasses</hi> his journey was hastened, but <hi>Morton</hi> would in no wayes condescend to their endeavours, rather restraining their tempestuous designes, as one who confides more to his owne innocency, and the Kings clemency, then their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate courses. Those Subjects that had behaved themselves valiantly and untaintedly towards their Countrey, were mindfull of <hi>Mortons</hi> demerits; and deplored their present condition, which proceeded from immoderate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty kept at home: others there were, and those not a few, whose Natures abhorred peace and quietnesse, either being effected with some injuries done them by the Protector, or with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, or other tempestuous stormes, hoped that this new forme of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:200469:75"/> Soveraignty would effect somtthing to satisfie their desires of revenge, or exalt them to some higher Dignity: <hi>James Balfour,</hi> who was either Enge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, or actor in all the Scottish trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Thomas Carr</hi> of Fernihurst, and <hi>Manderson,</hi> exited by the Banishment of the <hi>Humes</hi> of <hi>Coldinknowlls,</hi> and by other private injuries, proffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as adjutors to the Guardian of <hi>Arrane,</hi> whom they admire, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, obey. But few there were of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious extract, who voluntarily came in unto him, or any of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which did not tremble at, dread and fly from him as from some savage, and inhumane creature, because he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised his imbred severity upon the poore, or such who did not effect his money-racking way to manage his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
               <p>In these black mists, the Jesuites, and Popish Priests stole into Scotland, labouring of intestine sorrowes, that they might promote Popery, re-erect and confirme by their presence the drooping spirits of such as were Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected, and endeavour to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate matters in the State: the ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this crew was <hi>John Dury,</hi> who

               <p>But to returne; her Majesty of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land sent <hi>Thomas Randolph,</hi> Post-master Generall, Ambassadour into Scotland, to divert, if either wisedome or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency could effect it, the Cloud of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction hanging over Church and State; and to solicite for <hi>Morton,</hi> whose life and repute was in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to send away the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> an Antagonist of the English Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and elevate the mindes of such whose affections were concentricall with them. <hi>Randolph</hi> shewes his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Queen to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and Counsell, making splended recitall of those many demirrits done to King and Kingdome, even when <hi>FRANCE</hi> sacrificed her whole strength for her destruction; but the Kingdome of Scotland by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the English Forces, had pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her feet out from the French ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,

               <p>To which his Majesty gave answer, that for his Kinsman, in whom he had not found any crime; he was ready to satisfie the Law when ere he should be brought to his Triall; but it stood not with his honour to condemne a Noble
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:200469:77"/> man without suffering him to plead his defence, or giving audience: but thus he seemed to question the liberty of the kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> more then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports or deeds of <hi>Obigny;</hi> as for <hi>Morton</hi> he need not fear any punishment, before that he should be tried by his Peers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the crime whereof he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> who had set at nought the vigour of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by absenting himselfe, should have liberty to free himselfe from those most foule blots; but as for a prescription for future punishing, he could no ways condiscend thereto. Lastly it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to his Majesty, that <hi>James Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foure</hi> was actor of so many out-ranges in his Dominions: And having thus said, <hi>Randolph</hi> earnestly desires the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to begge <hi>Mortons</hi> life of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty: but being denyed, when he saw Prayers would not prevail, he menaced open warre.</p>
               <p>But the Ambassadours fulminations did not at all deterre his Majesties gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and sweet minde, who answered, that the fortune of a battle was incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and he was ready to defend his owne Coasts. Hereupon <hi>Randolph</hi> grew more enraged, as if he had been inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>But this rash Counsell was presently made knowne to his Majesty: <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi> being conscientious of his viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Embassage, got him privately to <hi>Barwick,</hi> and adviseth his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices <hi>Angusse</hi> and <hi>Marr</hi> to provide for their owne security.</p>

               <p>Much about this time <hi>James Steuart</hi> constituted Guardian over the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> by reason of his impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of minde, (which I commemorated before) being not satiated with the title of Guardian, and enjoying many commodities thereby, he was, (as if led by a Deity) created Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and confirmed by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ruine of that Family, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lawes and customes of their Predecessors: And this Omen <hi>Morton</hi> applyes to his owne ruine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the old Prophesie, that hee must take heed of the Earle of <hi>Arrane;</hi> nor was his supposition meere Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes, for the first act of this new Earle was the death of <hi>Morton:</hi> and here we
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:200469:81"/> may contemplate the variety of casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to him, as also the sports of fortune on him, now smiling, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently frowning, so that hee seemed to be tossed twixt the Rackets of honour and disgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morton</hi> being conducted speedily by the Earles of <hi>Arrane</hi> and <hi>Montross,</hi> with a great traine of armed men, and two Troops of Horse unto <hi>Edenborough,</hi> there to be tryed before the Peers, who were assembled to heare him plead the matter, the day of his tryall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and according to the ancient custome of the Kingdome: there was a place of Judicature constituted, where <hi>Arguile</hi> Chancellour, <hi>Montrosse</hi> chiefe Justice for that day, and divers others of the Nobility, sate upon the Bench; the prisoner being produced from custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, excepted against <hi>Arguile,</hi> in that he was no competent Judge, by reason of enmity, and irreconcible hatred, against the Lord <hi>Seton,</hi> by reason of inveterate envy, and against <hi>Vaughton,</hi> for suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted pretences against the King and State. But exceptions against Judges were not granted. <hi>Morton</hi> openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that the proceedings were disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and without president of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:200469:81"/> The Earle of <hi>Arrane</hi> and <hi>Robert Chreton</hi> his Majesties Advocate, even to the height of envy prosecuted the crime of Regicide against him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, because he had consented to the murthering of the King, and subscribed to the crime in love to <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi> But besides these bitter and many percunctations of <hi>Arrane,</hi> the Kings Advocate violently urgeth a Manifest signed by <hi>Mortons</hi> owne hand, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging likewise the hatred hee bore the State after his relinquishing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morton</hi> after a large commemoration of his Offices for the publique, proceeds to wash his hands of that most horrid murther, not palliating it with fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: for seeing hee could not deny the proofes against him, that hee was privy to the murther revealed by <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> being conscious of the detestable parracide: hee was condemned by the suffrages of the Nobility, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was denounced against him by <hi>Montrosse,</hi> who was invested with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream authority for that time: because as the accuser pertinaciously affirmed he did not prosecute the Law against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald Douglas</hi> of <hi>Wittingham,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:200469:82"/> and that being conscious to that detestable fact revealed by <hi>Bothwell</hi> to him, he kept in silence, he was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to prison, having a guard set over him, who were receivers of his words, fighs, and lookes, in that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned he kept silence, his expectation of his last houre was firme: so that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received that celestiall Manna of the Sacrament, his thoughts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about eternity and immortall life. Those Ministers that were there present, desired him to give his soul the wings of courage, seeing that death was not to be lamented, whose conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was immortality. He not at all daunted, knowing the lease of his life was almost expired, detests those sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, fixing his anchor of hope upon the shore of eternall safety: In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> inhumanely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his last necessity to approach, and desires him that ere he departed out of this pilgrimage, to subscribe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his criminations: but <hi>Mortons</hi> conversation being with heaven, having detruded all secular disturbances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that he was interrupted by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane &amp; wicked words. He was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Ministers admonitions go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:200469:82"/> undauntedly to the Market-place of <hi>Edenborough</hi> where he was to suffer; great was the concourse of people: and he not to be moved by the present feare of death, affected candor of speech and countenance, that his innocence in this paracide neither yet would he deny or dissemble, that <hi>Bothwel</hi> had solicited him for subscription to that truculent fact, but it was alwayes a Bug-beare and terrour to his thoughts: as for that hee did not give light to the crime, it was because hee was overswayed by feare of <hi>Bothwell's</hi> strong hand: and from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progresse herein, he converted his speech to his God in meditated and composed prayers, not being unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his Majesties fafety, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes tranquility, and the peoples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calumnity: having implored the most mercifull Fathers mercy, he shut up his prayers, desiring the Executioner to do his office. While he valiantly laid down his neck upon the fatall blocke, to the unspeakable sorrow of all; his head was parted from his body in the presence of that greedy spectator his enemy <hi>Farni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst:</hi> the head in steed of its body was exalted to stand upon the common hal; his body was interred without any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:200469:83"/> of funerall.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the last end of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the last Prorex of <hi>Scotland:</hi> He had been for naturall prudency, moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, integrity, and industry, celebrated by the trumpet of Fame, if his extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of money had not stained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie, and that act of delivering up for a sum of money <hi>Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> who fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if he had thirsted for his blood.</p>
               <p>Cruell <hi>Arran,</hi> not satiated with the punishment of so great a Peer, bended his nerves to eradicate the splendor of the <hi>Douglases,</hi> that his power might be established, he exterminated the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and hayled many servants (whose fidelity to their Lords were permanent) unto punishment and torture; the consequencies of <hi>Mortons</hi> death were domestical dissentions, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine grudges, and calamities: In sine the death of the author of his death, the Earl of <hi>Arran.</hi> The next day <hi>John Bine</hi> one of <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> servants was delivered to the truculency of a rope, in that hee participated in the Kings death; <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and <hi>Aberdower</hi> (the late Palaces and possessions of the Earle of <hi>Morton</hi>) unfortunate gifts were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:200469:83"/> upon <hi>Lenox,</hi> nor with much better successe <hi>John Maxwell</hi> had the honour and title of Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> in that it continued not long in that Family.</p>
               <p>And now that turbulent Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> seeing his corrivall removed, and the opposite faction laid in the dust, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from avarice &amp; cruelty to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mire of lust, contracting himselfe in a filthy marriage with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Stuart</hi> the daughter of the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> who in her childish yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjoyned in a nuptiall tye to the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> debased her selfe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with this new Earl for hope of domination, who did more fragrantly and constantly lust after her then her Husband did. And now seeing hee was Fortunes Favourite, nothing lesse would satisfie her, then to be his Wife and fellow ruler, striving to obtaine of the Ecclesiasticall Judges a divorce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of impotency. No time was intermitted for the divorce, nor many days had not appeared in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ere the strife was determined, and the just and legitimate matrimony was dissolved. Thus shee that was the late bedfellow of <hi>Lenox,</hi> being divorst from his most noble sheets; her belly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:200469:84"/> her pregnancy, without delay took upon her the title of Countesse of <hi>Arran,</hi> a very bad president; thus <hi>Arran</hi> was in one and the same day Husband and Father of an Infant begot by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous act, in anothers matrymony, borne in his own: hence arise all those vulgar clamours of her immodesty, wantonnesse, luxury, and lascivious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, not so much as her Followers but detested her incivility and his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, desiring her to consider this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented act, from whom she had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorst her selfe; was it not from one of the blood Royall, and his Majesties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate? and was shee not branded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with dishonesty? But her heart was so obdurate to relent into teares, the woman being of an insolent and proud spirit, desirous of a potent Husband, passed without those bounds nature had prefixed, her sex requireth, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome approves of: shee frequented vaulting flowers, usurped mens exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But I must stay my pen, lest these narrations intended for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, may occasion private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, by reason of the similitude of cafualties.</p>
               <p>When the State was thus overclou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200469:84"/> a Parliament was summoned to appear at <hi>Edenborough</hi> for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of publique affairs, where <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begny,</hi> whom Nobility, fame, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had made great, ascended to the highest seat of favour &amp; honour, and his creation of Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Parliament: He was arrived at that height of potency, as to govern things by his word: <hi>William Ruthen</hi> Treasurer was created Earl of <hi>Gowre, James Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran, John Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney:</hi> it was likewise adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>Douglasses</hi> should be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Rebels, banished, and their goods confiscated; thus that Family who had deserved well of their Countrey, was detruded, and cut downe by the anger and hatred of this new erected man: their enemies set their inventions to coyne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> against them, and their tongues to threaten, that this popular name might become odious to the vulgar.</p>
               <p>The King seeing his Exchequer at an ebb, and the Kingdome in poverty, according to an act of Parliament then made, revoked the donations of his patrimony, seized on the confiscations
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:200469:85"/> of mens estates, and reaped the first fruits, appointing limits for immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate donations and graunts. He esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished many Lawes commodious for the publique, and composed those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate dissentions twixt the <hi>Cordones</hi> and <hi>Forbosses,</hi> which arose about their bounders. The tenths and thirds of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Livings were employed for the sustentation of the Ministry, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pious offices, the revenues of the Monasteries were confiscated, and the rents brought into the Exchequer to support the publique treasury.</p>
               <p>By this time behold the Earle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> ready to burst with the too much indulgency of Lady <hi>Fortune,</hi> nay dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating even from civility, so that hee rejected the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> society, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his strength to undermine him, an act not a little offensive to the Prince, the first alination of affections arose from an affront offered unto one of the Dukes retinue by the Lord <hi>Seton</hi> and his son <hi>John.</hi> His Majestie beholding what a Charibdis his Kinsman the Duke sayled in, was so far enraged as to dimove <hi>Arran</hi> from being Captaine of the guard, commanding him not to approach the Court or the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:200469:85"/> nor think of being received into favor, unles he first submitted: he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Court to <hi>Kennel</hi> and there enjoyed the pleasures of his possessiōs, untill some happy mediators stood in the gap to make a reconciliation. Thus after a short divorce, the Dukes minde by the intercession of friends was allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an act of oblivion signed by both parties, and a reconciliation of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour made, which from that day was inviolably observed, both endeavouring with an equall vertuous impetuosity to lay low their Antagonists strength, both associated ther heads to keep their withstanders under. The young noble Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> who was suspected to be a Favourite of the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Court, but his return was obtained by his Mother, who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the crowne of many gray haires, and a continued power with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, both by her grave behaviour, and great care had over his childe-hood, which shee transacted with all the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an honest breast.</p>
               <p>The King well knowing that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was in her waine, that the title and honour of King was at a lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, enjoyned <hi>John Crage</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:200469:86"/> Chaplain, to set forth a confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, which contained the doctrines of Christian Religion, concerning God, the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Originall sin, the Law, grace, the Incarnation of the Word, the hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall union, Christs passion, Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ascencion, the holy Ghost, the Church, Scriptures, Fathers, Counsels, Sacraments, and controverted questions in Divinity. The King established it by Parliament, who having concorded in a forme of administring the Sacraments, all subscribed to the doctrine and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting that they would observe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with all their endeavours against oppositions. The King and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers first subscribed; next he desired the Nobles and Citizens to subscribe, with all exhorting them to embrace the true Religion, relieve the Poor, have an eye to the succourlesse and fatherlesse: Hee admonished the Ministry not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle with State affaires, but to preach the Gospell, administer the Sacraments, instruct the ignorant, call back the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from their wayes of errour, and the scandalous from their wallowing in filthinesse, to draw the people from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:200469:86"/> luxrious living and licentiousnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to continency, and observation of the Churches discipline, to make up the breaches of civill dissention amongst the Nobility, and to be carefull of the Churches peace, dignity, and safety. And lastly to excite the people if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes, yet by a strict discipline to follow vertue and obedience.</p>
               <p>The authority of the Ministerial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was unanimously consented to by Parliament, and that no other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ecclesiasticall should be set up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> save such as they agreed upon; and that all those dayes whom antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had set apart for holy remembrances, were not to be kept holy, or any cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration in apparel or solemn rites, were to be used thereon.</p>
               <p>The Ministers having got such a large Commission into their hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to attempt greater matters, as to pull downe the Prelaticall dignity. For in the Synod held at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Ponton</hi> was Prolocutor, the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall authority was abrogated, <hi>Patricke Adamson</hi> Arch-Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews, James Bode</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow, David Cunningham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen. Nigell Cambell</hi> who was the pearl of that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:200469:87"/> Function, Bishop of <hi>Arg.</hi> &amp; many other Superintendents, whose vertue &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had given them the lustre of fame: these were stiffe defenders of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates cause and dignity, 'gainst the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and potency of such Ministers, who sought by their maliciousnesse towards Episcopacy to get applause, labouring with wind and tide to root out Bishops. These men in a full house by suffrages and favour prevailed, so that it was concluded by Votes to abrogate the Prelates authority, which <hi>David Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> afterwards installed Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> desired to adjourn to the next Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his desires were frustrate, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve reviled by many, who protested his words were intollerable burthens to their consciences, and himself not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to beare any Ecclesiasticall Office▪ who patronized the most corrupt Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Function: many there were, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est they might seeme to strive against the streame, went downe with their tide to eradicate the Prelaticall splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
               <p>Fame slept not till she had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Majestie with the Synods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings herein, and <hi>Lindseyes</hi> interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the King having first consulted
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:200469:87"/> with his Counsell, (who hee knew were most emminent both for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and favour with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) what would be most convenient to the Kingdomes present condition, and being displeased at the affronts and injuries offered to the Bishops, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Messenger, that their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were every way displeasing unto him, and that he would apply a medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in due time.</p>
               <p>But they absolutely denyed, that they were ready to embrace any change in their opinions, declaring that the Regency of Church-affaires by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods Decree was at their disposall; and they having finished their work, begged of his Majesty, to let his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions issue forth concerning the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, giving his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all assent to the Synods determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the King crushed their desires by a denyall; because he fore-saw a great cloud of troubles to come from that act of Abrogating Episcopacy, and erecting by his command the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Discipline: he therefore hoped that they would, nay admonished them to desist from prosecuting their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous desires, and not to abuse the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:200469:88"/> power put into their hands to the Kingdomes destruction, by framing things after the modell of their wills, or strive the diruating the Prelates au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Thus the established Discipline of the Church runne with a more powerfull streame amongst the Nobility, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, and ignorant vulgar, though lesse favour with the King, by reason of their pride and arrogancy, who had not onely by his power put life into their semi-mortified Authority, but also established their potency over the people.</p>
               <p>But whilst these things were upon the Stage, his Majesty ceased not to adde vertue and knowledge to those his naturall Dowries, adorning the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of his breast with true Orientall Pearle, sporting himselfe with riding the great Horse, Tilting, and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>The yeare drawing to a period, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent <hi>Horiferous</hi> even wel-nigh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Arke of the Church, for <hi>James Boyd,</hi> having taken up his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the wormes, resigned his Chaire of <hi>Glascow</hi> to his Successor; the strife thereabout was so vehement, that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:200469:88"/> it had almost brought the Kingdome into a fit of distraction: in conclusion, <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> Preacher at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> who was both an eye-soare to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Commons, ascended to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall chaire, by the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> ayde: yet at the instigation of some friends, more looking upon their own utility then his dignity, lent him his hand to get the Mitre, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, that the Title and 1000 pounds annually should be involved upon him, not looking to reap any further fruit of his Benefice: The report hereof tooke the wings of the winde, and arrived at the ignorant multitude, and at the eares of some young Grammarians, who by their Orations blew up those Coales of Contention to a great flame of envy amongst the Nobles and Commons. Whereupon the Episcopall Antagonists take courage to spit infamous Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does from the Pulpit in the face of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> contaminating his whole life, as if unworthy ro beare rule in the Church.</p>
               <p>But the Privy Counsell calling these men to an account, reproved them with great bitternesse of speech, giving them to understand, that an Election having
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200469:89"/> the Kings consent, ought to be obeyed, and that for the good and profit of the weale-publike: Likewise they declared, that <hi>Montgomery</hi> was commanded to succeed by that authority devolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majesty: they therefore gave warning from any further Processe in such mollestations, but quietly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them their Diocesians whom his Majesty should assigne. Thus did the State stand for the present: but the fiery Spirits of the Ministers could not be extinguished: what the issue will be, the next yeare will declare.</p>
